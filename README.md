# Vibe Rush - Top-Down Multiplayer Physics Shooter

## The Challenge

Vibe Rush is a web-based top-down physics shooter created for the 2025 Vibe Coding Game Jam. The challenge was to build an instantly-loading, mobile-friendly multiplayer game that works directly in web browsers without any downloads or sign-ups. The game had to be at least 80% AI-coded and support multiple players in real-time combat. The biggest technical hurdles included implementing smooth physics on mobile devices, ensuring cross-device compatibility, and creating a fast-loading experience while maintaining the security of a server-authoritative game model.
